## 🎓 How It Works

The main goal of this application is to show how a two-context language model is trained. A language model predicts what word comes next in a sentence. In this case, it uses three key concepts:

1. **Context:** Understanding the previous words helps the model predict the next one.
2. **Training:** The application learns from a small set of example sentences to improve its accuracy.
3. **Probabilistic Models:** The app calculates the likelihood of each word as an option for the next word.

You can experiment with the model to see how it predicts different sentences using small animal-related data.

## 📘 Documentation and Support
